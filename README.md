# ToDo List Application

This is a simple console-based ToDo List application written in C# by me. It is part of my learning journey as I practice my coding skills to become a backend developer. The application allows users to add, view, delete, and clear tasks from their ToDo list. 

## Features

- **Add a new task**: Users can add new tasks to their ToDo list.
- **View tasks**: Users can view all tasks currently in their ToDo list.
- **Delete a task**: Users can delete a specific task from their ToDo list.
- **Clear all tasks**: Users can clear all tasks from their ToDo list.
